In this project I developed a resource management system in the hospital environment. 
By resources I mean human resources and equipment resources.
For human resources in particular :

       •	Doctors
       •	Horses
       •	Patients 

              

The application was simulated in five rooms of the hospital. Each room includes a microcontroller
that collects data from sensors installed in the room.Then through wireless communication it transmits
this data to a microcontroller that acts as a concentrator.
